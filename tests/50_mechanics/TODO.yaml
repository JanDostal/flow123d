02_terzaghi - test to fix output for DF

03_mandel
- 2D Mandel test
- problem with bottom BC - fixed zero Dir. => no analytic solution
- the weird thing is, that the block is deformed at first time step and later it only expands..
- data similar to Endorse tunnel test case
- works the same on both coarse and finer mesh

03_mandel_3d
- ohromny narust tlaku v prvnim kroce
- podivna deformace jako v 03_mandel (jina distribuce)

04_terzaghi
- according to Verruijt 2014 and Ferronato 2010 (data)
- lower storativity (*1e-6) causes divergence of nonlinear solver (precision of linear solver is not an issue)
- tried also different time scale and steps with no improvement | with higher storativity
- the Flow123d results (especially pressure) are far from analytical, I could not determine any reason
- solver divergence is also sensitive to Biot coefficient (higher B.c., worse divergence)

05_mandel_3d
- problem with BC and convergence
    - opposite forces on top and bottom => not converging (displacement unconstrained)
    - fixing bottom is OK

- 02, 03 - parallel tests return different results
